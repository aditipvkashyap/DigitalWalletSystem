# DigitalWalletSystem âœ¨
This is a digital wallet system which allows users to register, deposit/withdraw cash and transfer funds to other users.


I wasn't able to upload all the frontend files together due to the size but here is how the frontend folder was structured:
backend
frontend-
          public-
                  assets
                  favicon
                  _redirects
                  index 
                  logo
                  manifest
          src
          .dockerignore
          .eslintrc
          .prettierrc
          CHANGELOG
          Dockerfile
          jsconfig
          package
          package-lock
          yarn.lock
